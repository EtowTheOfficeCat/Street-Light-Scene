# Street-Light-Scene (Demo)
First light scene that I have created in Unity. Theme is a town street during a dark night lit by street lights and the buildings around it. I have used my own assets for the buildings in the street.[(Arstation)](https://www.artstation.com/paulmabon/albums/all)

Used two spot lights (for the streetlights) and one point light for the lamp at the restaurant. The windows of the Houses as well as the spotlight of the billboards are all quad planes with an emissive material.
